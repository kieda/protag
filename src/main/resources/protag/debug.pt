     * find print, where print is the actual node before substitutions
     * then match any number of nodes `X` following the print in the same segment
     *
     * the pattern is in the set of possible segments.
     * the matched rule is evaluated using a java static function which we pass args to
     * then the result is tagged for removal from the tree.
     * the resulting type of the RHS is in the set ^void
